Right now just a bibliography.  If you have helpful notes on these articles
you can put them in 'project.org'; I will take your pull requests or give you
commit rights.  Improvements to the bibliographic information will also be
gratefully accepted.

If you wonder why there are only dead symlinks in 'readings/', you will need
to get git-annex installed and 'git-annex get readings' and that (mostly) does
it.

Or if you have curl and an adequate unix-ish environment, you can use
'get-readings.sh' instead of git-annex.  It is also compatible enough with
git-annex that you can use it as a supplement if your git-annex has trouble
retrieving some of the URLs.
